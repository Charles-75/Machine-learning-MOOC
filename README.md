# Machine learning MOOC from Stanford university 

The description of the whole MOOC can be found here : https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning.  

The programming language that I used to complete those pratical exercices is Octave (language quite similar to Matlab with a lot of features in common). 

# Topics completed 

*  Week 1 : Linear regression with one variable, cost function, gradient descent, basics of linear algebra  
*  Week 2 : Multivariate linear regression, normal equation, gradient descent for multiple variables  
*  Week 3 : Logistic regression (univariate and multivariate), decision boundary, regularization (linear and logistic regression)  
*  Week 4 : Neural network model and representation, forward propagation, multiclass classification  
*  Week 5 : Neural network training, backpropagation  
*  Week 6 : Bias vs Variance, error analysis (learning curves, skewed data, etc.)  
*  Week 7 : SVM (Support Vector Machines)  
*  Week 8 : Unsupervised learning, K-means clustering, PCA  
*  Week 9 : Anomaly detection, multivariate Gaussian distribution, recommender systems (movie recommandation system, collaborative filtering)  
*  Week 10 : Large scale machine learning, gradient descent with large datasets (batch, mini-batch, stochastic)
